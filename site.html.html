               The Fat Geek Collection is a collection of 1088 unique NFTs â€” unique digital collectibles living on the Polygon blockchain. Each Fat Geek is unique and programmatically generated from over 157 possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, objects and more. Thanks to a sorting of thousands of Nft created, our team has worked to promote quality over quantity and now gives you access to this partly charitable collection. 3 different types of Fat Geek are available, 84 Baby Geeks, 938 Classic Fat Geeks and 66 Giant Geeks. Some Geeks are rarer than others.

              <div class="col-lg-6 order-2 order-lg-1">
                <p>Each Fat Geek is randomly created by algorithm from many drawn lines. After a long sequence of sorting by our team, we removed more than 90% of Fat Geeks and kept the most charismatic. <br />
                Traits are characteristics that include expression, appearance, clothing, accessories, etc. of the character.
                <br />
                Each trait is randomly chosen with a specific probability to generate thousands of unique possibilities.<br />
                Some Classic Fat Geek are rarer than others, their price is set according to their overall style. Their price varies from 0.003 ETH for the vast majority and up to 0.01 ETH for the most stylish.<br />
                Our development team believes that creating all clothing accessories etc. are relatively similar and should not influence the final price.
                There are only 89 Baby Geeks, and therefore are rarer and their base values vary from 0.015 to 0.04 ETH for the most bad ass.
                Finally the Giant Geeks are only 66 and are the most evolved versions of the Fat Geeks. Buying a Giant Geek is 0.05 ETH</p>
                Fat Geeks are stored as an ERC-1155 token on the Polygon blockchain.
                To access the members-only areas, Fat Geeks holders will need to be logged into their Metamask wallet.</p>

                <p>Buying a Fat Geek is not just buying an avatar or digital art of proven rarity.
The purchase will allow access to the community and to develop the rest of the project.<br />
